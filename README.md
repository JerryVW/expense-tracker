<h2>Summary</h2> 

<p>Building this expense tracker furthered my understanding of javascript. It was a good challenge to get all the 
elements to display out in a table format. Knowing how to do this will help me when working with data from a backend server.</p> 

<p>I also used local storage on this project. That proved to be a bigger challenge than what I thought. But it was a
great learning experience.</p>
